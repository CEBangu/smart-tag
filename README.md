# SMART TAG
## A better way of tagging your friends in Instagram Stories

Ever been annoyed at how hard it is to tap on tags on Instagram stories? Ever wanted to tag your friends but didn't want to ruin your pic with text? 
Well, Smart Tag solves these problems! Using Image Segmentation, Smart Tag allows you to tag your friends themselves, rather than relying on text! 
Now, you can tap the person themselves to find their profile, rather than fighting with tiny, annoying, nametags. 
While only a **demo**, hopefuly Instagram can implement something like this in the near future. 

Here's a video demonstrating how it works:

## Instructions to run
To run at home, the best performance is when it is simulated on an iPhone 16 Pro, with a non-zoomed standard camera image. It can also be built to your device. 
Model backend is YOLO11-medium Segmentation. Since it is only a demo, the code is üçù.
